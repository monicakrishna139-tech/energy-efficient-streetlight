# energy-efficient-streetlight
Energy-efficient streetlight system using ambient light sensors and Arduino
## 📌 Abstract  
This project uses **ambient light sensors** to automatically control streetlights.  
The system ensures that lights are **ON only when required** (during low light conditions) and **OFF during daylight**, thereby reducing energy consumption and promoting smart energy usage.  

## 🛠 Skills Applied  
- C++ Programming  
- Sensor Interfacing (LDR/Light sensors)  
- Arduino programming and debugging  

## ⚙️ Tools Used  
- Arduino IDE  
- Hardware: Arduino board, LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), LEDs  

## 🚀 How it Works  
1. The **LDR sensor** continuously measures the ambient light level.  
2. If the light intensity falls below a certain threshold, the streetlight (LED) turns **ON**.  
3. If sufficient natural light is detected, the light turns **OFF** automatically.
